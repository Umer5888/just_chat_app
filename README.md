Just Chat App

## Getting Started

I developed this application using Flutter, a powerful cross-platform framework, combined with Firebase for robust backend support.

Key features include:

User Authentication: Secure login and sign-up processes, leveraging Firebase Authentication for a smooth and reliable experience.
Real-time Messaging: Instant text messaging powered by Firebase Firestore, allowing users to exchange messages in real-time.
Contact Management: An integrated contact system that syncs with users' device contacts, making it easy to connect with friends and family.
Cross-Platform Support: Developed with Flutter, the app runs smoothly on both iOS and Android, providing a consistent user experience across devices.

Just Call is designed with user convenience and security in mind, ensuring a reliable and user-friendly communication platform.
